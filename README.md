- 👋 Hi, I’m @jwaisome
- 👀 I’m interested in critical mentorship and self-efficacy research in science, tech, engineering, mathematics, and computing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that I'm only one person (delegation is key)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on NOTHING ELSE (at least, not right now)
- 📫 How to reach me www.jeremywaisome.com or wwww.prisemlab.com (neither are updated... don't judge)
